# Today

A minimal To-Do list with adjustable deadlines.

### Philosophy

The intent of the deadlines is to help user (me) set realistic deadlines. The tasks is either completed or not in the provided time frame. If I've missed it, I will have to accept that and make another task to finish the job.

### Features
	* No frills console To-Do list
	* History of tasks
	* Customizable via source code

### Customize

The config.h file contains various options that one can tweak.

### Dependencies

The code depends on Boost.DateTime and rang.hpp libraries.

### How I use it

I've put it in my .bashrc file, so that each time open a terminal window I would be reminded of my tasks.
